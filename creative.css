Hi %(name)s,

Thank you so much for coming out to audition for the Asymptones. 
Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you a callback this fall. 
We had a very competitive audition cycle and would love to hear you
back next year. MIT has a lot of awesome opportunities to take 
advantage of (such as Concert Choir and other groups), 
so definitely be sure to keep singing and explore your passion for music. 
Have a wonderful semester!

Best,
Jacqui De Sa
